NAME
    Plack::App::File::CaseInsensitive - Serve static files with case
    insensitive paths

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
     use Plack::App::File::CaseInsensitive;
     my $app = Plack::App::File::CaseInsensitive
        ->new(root => "/path/to/htdocs")->to_app;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a static file server PSGI application that tries its best to
    work with urls that have a different case than the files on disk. The
    idea is to help porting away from case insensitive systems like Windows.
    It probably doesn't work very well for unicode and it is certainly
    inefficient, but it is mostly just made as a stopgap. It will warn when
    the case insensitive codepath is triggered and it will also warn if it
    finds multiple files with the same case insensitive name (ie "foo" and
    "FOO".)
